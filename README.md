# A list of things that one wants to get done or that need to get done: No, I haven't bought the gift yet, but it's on my to-do list.
# One of the most important reasons for keeping a to-do list is the organization. Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.
